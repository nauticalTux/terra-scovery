My Terraform discoveries! 

## AWS 

The **aws/** directory contains my AWS Terraform expirements. The **tf_wizard/** in particular is a reimplementation of all the components launched when using the AWS Console; including VPC, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, Subnets, Security Groups, and finally the EC2 instance itself.
